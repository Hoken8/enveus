              <p>
                This guide serves as a generalized introduction to Ashes of
                Creation Alpha 2. This is an Alpha and is not a completed game;
                bugs, exploits, and crashes will be frequent. Understand that we
                are playing Alpha 2 to provide feedback and interaction with the
                game to help Intrepid Studios&apos; development process. Have
                patience and expect that you will crash, die randomly, lose
                characters or items, and do not burn yourself out.
              </p>

              <p style={{ color: "orange" }}>
                Ashes of Creation is in an Alpha phase. Everything is subject to
                change and you will be testing a game to make it better. It is
                not a released product. This is a PvX game... kill or be killed.

                  <li>

                  <li>

                  <li>
                    ❌ Don&apos;t sell resources or glint to shops unless you

                    You can level faster if you don&apos;t spend a ton of time

              <h2>Suggested Group Gear Distribution</h2>
              <p>
                Loot is not player/client specific, but shared between the group
                that participated in the kill. Because of this, gear should be
                distributed in a way that is beneficial to the group as a whole
                by increasing the rate at which mobs can be killed and more loot
                obtained.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p style={{ color: "orange" }}>
                Group/Raid Leaders have the option to modify the loot options in
                Game Options &gt; Gameplay &gt; Looting. The suggested settings
                are &quot;Need or Greed&quot; for all rarities, even common.
